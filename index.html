        Cuphead was the first game by StudioMDHR, a Canadian indie game development studio consisting of brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer.<br>
        Additional animation work was contributed by Jake Clark, with programming lead by Eric Billingsley.<br>
        Its development began in 2010 using the Unity game engine, and it was developed from the brothers' homes in Oakville, Ontario and Regina, Saskatchewan, respectively.<br>
        The game was inspired by cartoons produced by the Fleischer and Walt Disney animation studios.<br>
        Chad Moldenhauer called Fleischer Studios "the magnetic north of his art style", and particularly sought to mimic their "subversive and surrealist" elements.<br>

        <br>The Moldenhauers watched 1930s-era cartoons in their youth, which Chad Moldenhauer describes as happenstance, based on gifts and VHS compilations. <br>
        Among other siblings in their Regina, Saskatchewan childhood home, the two shared aesthetic taste and interest in gameplay. <br>
        They attempted a game in the style of Cuphead in 2000, but lacked the tools to continue. <br>
        The brothers decided to try again following the success of the indie game Super Meat Boy, which released in 2010. <br>
        The character that became Cuphead descended from a 1936 Japanese propaganda animated film where a man with a teacup for a head morphs into a tank. <br>
        The Moldenhauers emulated the animation because they found it strange, and "right away it stuck".<br>
        Before settling on him as the main character, the brothers had created around 150 different character designs, including a kappa in a tophat and characters with a plate or fork for a head.<br>
        
        <br>The animation techniques behind Cuphead are similar to that of the 1930s cartoons.
        Chad Moldenhauer, who had previously worked in graphic design, would hand-draw the animations and paint the backgrounds using watercolors, colorizing them in Photoshop.<br>
        The gameplay runs at a framerate of 60, while the animation runs at 24, which is a film standard. Chad Moldenhauer also saw his process with its human imperfections as a reaction to the perfectionism of pixel art.<br>
        Jared Moldenhauer worked on other aspects of the game, though they would discuss gameplay design together. <br>
        Their studio hired a Romanian developer, a Brooklyn animator, and an Ontario jazz musician for the project. <br>
        They sought to keep the recording processes of the time period as if the team were developing in that era.<br>
        The score for the game was composed by Kristofer Maddigan, and consists of 51 tracks performed by jazz and big band musicians.<br>
